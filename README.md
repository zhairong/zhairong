Hi, my name is Rong Zhai, come from China. I'm Java Developer.
I’m interested in coding and woodworking, yes, I think they are same things.
I’m currently learning AWS and Docker. Because I started with Java Enterprise, 
and now I discover the new world, I already hear about it for many years, but I worked as legacy developer, 
no chance to use it. but it is realy interesst me.
Some idea just send me email: zhairong1975@gmail.com
